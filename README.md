# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## Overview of Project

This project analyzes Kickstarter data to uncover trends in campaign strategies. It organizes, sorts, and filters the data set to focus on Theater Campaigns, specifically the plays subcategory. The project continues by narrowing in on two main strategic factors: campaign launch dates and campaign funding goals.  

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to assist the client, Louise, as she embarks on her journey to launch a Kickstarter campaign for her play, "Fever", which she estimates should have a budget of about $10,000. Our goal is to use existing crowdfunding data from Kickstarter to hone in on a few possible winning strategies that Louise can mirror in her own Kickstarter campaign to secure the best possible outcome for her play.

## Analysis and Challenges


Once those conversions were complete,  The catagorical data for the type of campaign was separated into parent categories and their subcategories.

Data was then sorted into pivot tables that narrowed in on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date as the client, Louise requested.

Created the first pivot table sorting Kickstarter data by three of the four potemtial Outcomes, "successful," "failed," and "canceled," and filtering for the "Theater" parent category and "Years." This table may be found on the sheet titled "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date". 

This did not take into account differences in campaign goals. Were these Theater campaigns more or less successful depending on the dollar amounts of their fundraising goals?

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The first challenge in analyzing this data set was in converting date related data from Unix Timestamps to the easier to analyze Human (Month, Day, Year) format.

## Results
In the creation of our first pivot table, we could immediatly see significant numbers of successful campaigns were launched in May and June for all of the years recorded in the data set. While more campaigns overall were also launched in these two monhs, looking at a line graph shows a large gap between the successful campaigns line and the lines for failed or canceled campaigns. This could be demonstrative of a possible trend in success for campaigns launched in May and June.  

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

##Limitations
- This data set is mainly limited to quantifiabled data and relatively simple booleans and categories.  It is unable to discuss or compare more detailed information about marketing strategies of the campaigns. For example, how did campaigners get the word out to contributors about their Kickstarter campaigns?  This is probably difficult to quantify but can make a big impact on the success of a campaign. Did a celebrity share the Kickstarter to their social media? How many facebook/Instagram/Twitter followers did each capmpaign starter have? Is the campaign run by individuals who already have strong connections with potential contributors? 


##Some additional tables and graphs to potentially be created:

 --Play Outcomes by Luanch Date analyzing any potential stronger trends specifically for plays  
 
 --Total Campaign Time Lengths vs. Outcomes Based on Launch Date analyzing if there might be a trend in shorter or longer time frames needed to reach campaign goals depending on what months of the year they are launched and by the dollar amounts of their campaign goals.
