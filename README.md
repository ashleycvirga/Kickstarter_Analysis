# **Kickstarting with Excel**

## Overview of Project

This project analyzes Kickstarter data to uncover trends in campaign strategies. It organizes, sorts, and filters the data set to focus on Theater Campaigns, specifically the plays subcategory. The project continues by narrowing in on two main strategic factors: campaign launch dates and campaign funding goals.  

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to assist the client, Louise, as she embarks on her journey to launch a Kickstarter campaign for her play, "Fever", which she estimates should have a budget of about $10,000. Our goal is to use existing crowdfunding data from Kickstarter to hone in on a few possible winning strategies that Louise can mirror in her own Kickstarter campaign to secure the best possible outcome for her play.

## Analysis and Challenges

The first challenge in analyzing this data set was in converting date related data from Unix Timestamps to the easier to analyze Human (Month, Day, Year) format.
Once those conversions were complete,
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Does not discuss marketing strategies of the campaign. For example, how did campaigners get the word out to contributors about their Kickstarter campaigns?  This is probably difficult to quantify but can make a big impact on the success of a campaign.  Did a celebrity share the Kickstarter to their social media? Is the campaign run by individuals who already have strong connections with potential contributors?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
